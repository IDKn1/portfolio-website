### Problem

Travelers often experience a sense of disconnection when they enter unfamiliar places, especially when dealing with foreign currencies, local customs, or navigating unknown environments. This can create a feeling of alienation hindering the full enjoyment of travel and exploration.

### Insight

> A better travel experience comes from feeling present and like you belong, whether planning, arriving, or spending money locally. Travel is more enjoyable when it feels seamless, like you’re part of the local culture, rather than just an outsider.

### Solution

Wise's "Pay Like You Belong" campaign highlights the Wise card, designed to eliminate the hassle of foreign currency, helping travelers feel more immersed in the local culture. With seamless payment options, personalized guides, and real-time local integrations, Wise ensures that travelers experience a journey where they truly belong.

### Phase 1

Your trip starts long before your flight, it's in the planning, the daydreaming, the places you pass through every day. For those already starting their next trip, Wise meets them where they are—right within their everyday commute. Found there will be ads in subway stations and billboards along their travel route.

### Phase 2

The next touchpoint happens in travel hubs (airports, train stations, transition points). There, travellers will find travel guides containing ready to activate Wise cards. The local guide books will be styled to look like passports, as when travelling most people already have passports and travel documents on their mind. Focused on local, lesser-known and less crowded locations, the guide books highlight locations aimed at conversation and connection.

### Phase 3

Lastly, Wise will partner up with local shops, cafés, and travel spots to run point-of-sale activations. As the traveler arrives and starts interacting with the local economy, Wise’s integration becomes evident.

Whether it’s buying a coffee at a café or picking up a souvenir from a local shop, Wise comes to life in the everyday moments. No matter where you shop, Wise is with you every step of the way.

> Wise becomes more than a payment method, it becomes your passport to local discoveries. You’re not just travelling, you're connecting to the world around you. When you travel with Wise you stop second-guessing yourself and start paying like you belong.
