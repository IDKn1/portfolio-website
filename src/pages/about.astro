                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi I'm Nikolai! I'm an Advertising major with a deep interest in how people connect—with each other, with ideas, and with the world around them. I believe communitiy and connection are at the heart of all great advertisements and I’m passionate about exploring how storytelling, design, and technology can foster those connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not working on creative projects, I relax by biking downtown, experimenting in the kitchen (or searching for the next great bite), or disappearing down an internet rabbit hole—anything from niche topics to the latest in open source software. I love learning for the sake of learning, and constantly have new hobbies leading to a bunch of random info rattling around in my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it’s through a campaign, a conversation, or a deep dive into something obscure, I’m always looking for the human connection within it.
                </p>
