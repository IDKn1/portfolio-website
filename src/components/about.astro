        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi I'm Nikolai! I'm an ad major with a deep interest in how people connect—with each other, with ideas, and with the world around them. I also have a not-so-small obsession with archiving, documenting, and saving just about everything around me. I believe connection is the core of all great advertising, and I’m hooked on exploring how storytelling and design can foster those connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not working on creative projects, I'm out biking downtown, experimenting in the kitchen (or searching for my next favourite dish), tinkering with a coding project or selfhosting something new, or getting lost down an internet rabbit hole. I love learning and constantly have new hobbies leading to a bunch of random info rattling around in my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it’s through a campaign, a conversation, or a deep dive into whatever has caught my interest, I’m always looking for the human connection within it.
