    <p>
      Hi I'm Nikolai! I have a not-so-small obsession with archiving,
      documenting, and saving just about everything around me. I believe
      connection is the core of all great advertising, and I’m passionate about
      exploring how storytelling and design can foster those connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not working on creative projects, I'm out biking downtown,
      experimenting in the kitchen (or searching for my next favourite dish),
      tinkering with a coding project, or getting lost down an internet rabbit
      hole. I love learning and constantly have new hobbies leading to a bunch
      of random info rattling around in my head.
