# Portfolio feedback 2025-05-13

## John ACD

### Wise

- phase 1 could also be read as for people who have just come to canada, doesn't say just travel
- maybe add somethign to speak to travel within the visuals
- the 3 poster mockup is a good example of what he meant by that
- style the local guide to look more like a passport
- organization of the project page is great
- the cash register could have a more direct cta than just the main strapline

## Amelia CW

### Wise

- cut out "want to" in the 2 poster phase 3 mock and just to straight to skip the math
- puncuaction consistancy across all ads
- possibly shorten the atm copy

### Fond

- look into sweet jesus and how it started as just an ad before becoming what it is now
- maybe include examples of dinner party ideas
- possible places to advertise the website and movement as a whole could include cooking classes, recipe websites, food ads

## Kylie AD

### Wise

- play with other laguages within the ads

### Fond

- (my own note to self) the logo doesn't make an appearence currently only the wordmark is on the site

## Michelle ACD

### Wise

- the local activation phase 3 might be happening too late if the goal is to get people to use the Wise card (check website on ease of signup and what Wise says about the signup process)
- figure out how to intercept when people are thinking of travel possible at their home bank or cash exchange
- be single minded don't bother with a 4th phase for when they get back that isn't the goal you've set for your campaign

### Fond

- execute! now that you have this make ads for it and sell it
- use the photos from the event and invites
- show how you are pushing people to become a part of Fond / slash become aware of Fond
- could be OOH or social ads

### General

- need more than 2 projects on your portfolio website

## Laura Designer

### Wise

- a qr code that translates posters to different languages during phase 3 could be cool
- experiemtn with a slight color change of the currency symbols in the headlines so it becomes more clear
- maybe try adding a background texture to the text heavy billboards or try using an outline of the Wise card as a background for the headline if on a photo or busier background

### Fond

- really strong identity
- target public events or festivals as locations for ads. Play of the tangibility / physical nature of being in a place
- fond meat scraps as a motif for branding
- focus on texture / physicality i.e logo stamps on items etc.

## Gail ECD

### Wise

- insight need to be more clear
- remove the "?" from the 3 poster in phase 1
- maybe do digital instead of guide book (Gail said who uses physical guide books now)
- look into Roadside Market by Mastercard
- equation in phase 3 2 poster mock instead / reword
- make phase 1 billboard more focused currently doesn't fit insight
- tighten leading, move strapline under logo in phase 1 executions
- general look and feel maybe money or maps as a background texture
- change an ad major in bio to art director (fake it till you make it, don't sell yourself as just a student)

## Jordan CW

### Wise

- think of other ways to bring things to life besides the guide book
- possibly airport ads as well in phase 2

### General

- clear path / narrative in the projects
